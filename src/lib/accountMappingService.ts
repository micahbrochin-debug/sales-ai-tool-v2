ü§ñ CLAUDE ASSISTANT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:

To implement real executive discovery for ${request.companyName}:

1. Use WebSearch tool with these queries:
   - site:linkedin.com "${request.companyName}" CEO CTO CISO CFO COO
   - site:linkedin.com "${request.companyName}" "VP Engineering" "VP Security" "VP Product"
   - site:linkedin.com "${request.companyName}" "Director Security" "Director Engineering"
   - site:theorg.com "${request.companyName}" organizational chart leadership
   - site:crunchbase.com "${request.companyName}" executives leadership team
   - "${request.companyName}" "announces" "new CEO" OR "new CTO" OR "promotes"

2. Use WebFetch tool to crawl:
   - https://${request.companyDomain || generateCompanyDomain(request.companyName)}/leadership
   - https://${request.companyDomain || generateCompanyDomain(request.companyName)}/about
   - https://${request.companyDomain || generateCompanyDomain(request.companyName)}/team
   - Any TheOrg.com pages found
   - Any Crunchbase pages found

3. Parse results to extract:
   - Executive names and titles
   - LinkedIn profile URLs
   - Reporting relationships
   - Department assignments
   - Verification sources

4. Build comprehensive AccountMap with 15+ executives
   - C-Suite: CEO, CTO, CISO, CFO, COO
   - VP Level: Engineering, Security, Product, Sales
   - Director Level: Security, Engineering, Operations
   - Senior Staff: Principal Engineers, Architects

Target: Match quality of custom GPT that finds executives like:
