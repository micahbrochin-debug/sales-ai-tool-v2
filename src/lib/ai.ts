Normalization & extraction rules:
- Dates: Convert month names/abbreviations to MM. Map "Dec 2024 – Present" → start="2024-12", end="Present".
- Titles/companies: keep original casing; fix obvious OCR splits (e.g., 'Micro soft').
- Bullets: Split long lines into crisp bullets; don't rewrite facts; remove page-footer noise (e.g., "Page 1 of 4").
- If the raw text has a combined line like "Director - Information Security at Haventree Bank", prefer:
  title="Director - Information Security", company="Haventree Bank".
- Certifications that look like credentials (ITIL, CompTIA A+, Kanban) go into skills.certifications.
- If confident a token is a tool vs. a core skill, classify under skills.tools (e.g., "F5 BigIP", "Microsoft Exchange").
- Put any uncertainties into missing_fields and keep parse_status="partial" if critical fields are missing.`;
