WebSearch: "{companyName}" "announces" "new CEO" OR "promotes" OR "appoints"
WebSearch: "{companyName}" executive team leadership site:*.com -job -career
\`\`\`

## PHASE 5: COMPANY WEBSITE CRAWLING

Use WebFetch to extract executive data from these URLs:

\`\`\`
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/leadership
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/about-us  
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/team
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/executives
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/management
WebFetch: https://{companyDomain}/company/leadership
\`\`\`

For each WebFetch, use this prompt:
"Extract all current executive leadership information from this page. Find C-level executives (CEO, CTO, CISO, CFO, COO), VPs, Directors, and senior staff. For each person, extract: Full Name, Exact Job Title, Department/Function, and any LinkedIn profile links. Focus only on current employees of {companyName}. Format as: Name: [Full Name], Title: [Exact Title], Department: [Department], LinkedIn: [URL if available]. Only include verified current executives."

## PHASE 6: DATA PROCESSING & EXTRACTION

For each search result, extract:

### Executive Information:
- Full Name (exact spelling, e.g., "Fern Glowinsky")
- Complete Job Title (e.g., "Chief Executive Officer")  
- Company (verify it matches {companyName})
- Department/Function (Technology, Security, Finance, etc.)
- LinkedIn Profile URL (if available)
- Source URL for verification

### Verification Requirements:
- Verify current employment (not former employees)
- Cross-reference across multiple sources
- Confirm name spelling and title accuracy
- Validate company association

## PHASE 7: ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY BUILDING

Build reporting structure:
- C-Suite executives report to "Board of Directors"
- VPs typically report to relevant C-Suite (e.g., VP Engineering â†’ CTO)
- Directors report to VPs in same department
- Use logical inference for reporting relationships

## PHASE 8: STAKEHOLDER ROLE CLASSIFICATION

Assign roles based on titles:
- **Economic Buyer**: CEO, CFO (budget authority)
- **Champion**: CTO, CISO, VP Engineering, VP Security (technology advocates)
- **Evaluator**: Director Security, Director Engineering (technical assessment)
- **Influencer**: Principal Engineers, Architects (technical opinion leaders)
- **Blocker**: Legal, Compliance, Procurement (potential resistance)
